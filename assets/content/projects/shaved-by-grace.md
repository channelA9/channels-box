Shaved by Grace is a seasonal business in Redlands that serves authentic and all natural Japanese-style shaved ice, known as kakigōri (かき氷). They take pride in the fact that their machines and ice are imported from Japan, and put an emphasis on quality over quantity.

I was tasked with designing a professional business website for them that not only advertised their product, but could also handle 
customer reservations in a backend database in order to help improve the efficiency of their operation. 

To achieve this, I designed a fully functional reservation booking system similar to OpenTable, wherein customers could book times set through an secure admin dashboard. Users can create and delete their reservations, while the business owners could create and delete hours or view scheduled appointments.
