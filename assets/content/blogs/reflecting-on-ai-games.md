For as much as the LLM hype-train has seemed to roll the past two years, it still seems like the base experience has remained unchanged when applied to games or chatbot experiences. I don’t think there’s anything that’s fundamentally moved the bar of user experience from that of just typing text to a bot and having it respond back with more text. 

Sometimes you can make it do some fancier stuff like analyze your photos or respond with a fancy AI voice, but as long as it’s an LLM powering everything at the core it still feels… lacking, in a way. 

I’m more than certain that the future is going to see the experience improve more and more. For now, though, what I think needs to change is the way in which LLMs are utilized by game developers. Games need to play to the strengths of what these tools can do without making it wholly relying on it to make the experience. 

I think that something different can be made compared to what I’ve seen so far. Rather than just another ChatGPT frontend that claims to be the next productivity tool or glorified story generation tool, maybe we can make games that trust LLMs to make more logic-based decisions, rather than simply generating creative content. 

We don’t have to substitute every game system with AI, and I think if the right mix of the two is achieved, great things can happen.

Nothing says I’m the first to think of this. I bet you there are plenty of cool people trying this out in both indie and large game studios. The most recent example I can think of that seems to push the bounds here is [Suck Up!](https://www.playsuckup.com/), which is a game where the user has to convince random people in a town to let them in despite the fact they’re a vampire. In this game, the LLM is entrusted with powering the logic of the NPCs, adding versatility and consistency in a way that no traditional kind of game design can without simply just making another ChatGPT wrapper.

I also recently read an article about how Blizzard was testing AI-powered NPCs, where you could talk with them through a mic and they would do things like generate quests for you or respond to generic discussion prompts. That was around a year or two ago, I think. It’s definitely something we’ll see more of now that LLMs continue to mature and get cheaper. Heck, there’s already some startups moving in on this emerging field like [Inworld AI](https://inworld.ai/). 

If you know of any other cool games that utilize AI like this, do let me know! I’d love to keep up with this emerging section of the industry. However, I wonder if all these applications of AI into games remain focused on the wrong things. I feel like there is a certain kind of game that can be created by allowing for just the right amount of AI logic to make a compelling and immersive kind of experience.

In the coming months, I’m hoping to create a few projects that can explore the kinds of games and experiences that can be made using this stuff. I hope you’ll check them out when I (eventually) get them made!
